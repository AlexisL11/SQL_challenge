My secret to effective multitasking is prioritization. I like to break my tasks into smaller tasks, set a priority sequence, and essentially treating it as one task with deadlines in mind. I find gratification in getting more work done, so I prefer to take on a little more. 

I recently spoke to a customer who was upset about not receiving some benefits after purchasing one of the company's products. First, I made sure I listened to her story and apologized and empathized with her. Then, I offered to fix it by walking her through the product and how she would get the reward. By the end of the call, she had received her reward and was extremely happy. She offered to give a good review for understanding her and helping her with the challenge.
